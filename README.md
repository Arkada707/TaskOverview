# Task overview is now finish/completed

Task overview is a website where you can add your tasks and it records when you have finished them and more.
Task overview is the first website that I have built.
You may follow this template for your web application.


The files used to deploy is netlify.
If you want to know how to deploy it, you may ask ChatGPT :)

Other than that there are some notes:


1 - There is an issue for download task but don't worry there is always screenshot as not many are using the download feature.

2 - If you want to see check out the website: https://taskoverview.netlify.app

3 - If you want any feature to implement into the website let me know.

4 - It's been a journey but I believe that I am done for this project.

5 - Yea that's pretty much it. Have fun
